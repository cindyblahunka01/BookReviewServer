# Welcome to My Book Review!

This is the server side of a PERN stack full CRUD [book review app]() in which users can see a list of bestseller books and make notes on books they would like to read and create reviews on book they have read. This server follows the MVC pattern and uses Postgres as the database management system.

## Project Requirements
This server was completed during my final badge of [EFA's](https://elevenfifty.org/) web development course. It displays my understanding of the following:
- PostgreSQL
- Express
- Node
- REST APIs
- Creating API Endpoints
- React Basics
- Connecting Server and Client

## Steps to run this server
- Clone this repository (git clone)
- Run git remote remove origin
- Run npm install to get any dependencies
- Create .env file (look for process.env fields in db.js)
- Create database in pgAdmin
- Use Postman to test endpoints
- Set up your own repository on Github and push your code
